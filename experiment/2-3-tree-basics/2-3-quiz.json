            "answers": {
                "a": "We need not implement searching in order to do Insertion or Deletion in a 2-3 tree.",
                "b": "Insertion and Deletion processes in a 2-3 tree may also involve other operations like merging, splitting, and redistribution of the elements in the tree.",

            "explanations": {
                "a": "Searching still needs to be implemented in order to Insert or Delete in a 2-3 tree.",
                "b": "What makes Insertion and Deletion in a 2-3 tree different from that in a binary search tree is the different actions that need to be performed so that the properties of a 2-3 tree are not violated.",
                "c": "Only Searching is similar in binary search tree and 2-3 trees. Insertion and Deletion follow different processes in 2-3 trees."

            "explanations": {
                "a": "Although Insertion and Deletion processes are different between 2-3 trees and Binary Search trees, the Searching process is pretty much the same.",
                "b": "Searching in 2-3 trees and binary search trees are similar as the data elements in each node are ordered in both the trees. We normally direct a search function to the correct subtree and eventually the correct node with the desired item is found."
